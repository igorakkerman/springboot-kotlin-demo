# Spring Boot Kotlin Demo

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- **JDK 11** or higher must be installed.
- **Docker 19.03.0** or higher must be installed and Docker daemon must be running locally.

### Build the application
Build the application as an OCI container to the local Docker daemon:
```shell
./gradlew build jibDockerBuild
```
### Run the application locally
Run the application locally along with the database using Docker Compose:
```shell
cd local
docker-compose up -d
```

### Make some API requests
Use *curl* to make requests to the API
```shell
curl -i  http://localhost:8080/devices -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "type": "computer",
    "id": "pc-123",
    "name": "My fovorite Mac",
    "username": "timapple",
    "password": "0n3m0r3th1ng",
    "ipAddress": "10.0.0.1"
}' 
```

Expected response:
```http request
HTTP/1.1 201
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Sat, 03 Apr 2021 22:28:43 GMT
```

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8080/devices
```

Expected response:
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Sat, 03 Apr 2021 22:33:31 GMT

[{"type":"{"type":"computer","id":"pc-123","name":"My fovorite Mac","username":"timapple","password":"0n3m0r3th1ng","ipAddress":"10.0.0.1"}]
```

## Domain
An office rental company owns multiple coworking spaces 
providing their guests with devices like computers, displays, coffee machines etc.
Each device has an id, a type and a name.
Additionally, a device can have configuration properties specific to its type.
A computer, for instance, can have a username, a password and an ip address.

## Application
The application is a backend service that stores configurations of differant devices.
It provides an API endpoint that allows clients to:
- create a configuration for a new device
- update the configuration of an existing device
- retrieve the configuration of a device by its id 
- list all device configurations

### Assumptions
- The application only models elements specifically mentioned in the requirements.
  For instance, coworking spaces holding the devices are _not_ represented.
- All configuration values are mandatory.
- A device id is a semantic value (like a serial number), a UUID or 
  any other unique string provided to this application by the application client,
  it is not a synthetic surrogate key generated by this application.

- Listing all device configurations does not require any specific order.
- Once a device is stored in the database, its ID and type cannot be modified.
- Device passwords can be stored and retrieved in plain text. 
  In a real-world application, they would be either hashed and salted or encrypted at rest,
  depending on the purpose for which they are stored.
  In both cases, they would be stored in a separate part of the database with stricter access control
  and also have dedicated, additionally protected endpoints.
- Access control to the API and other security concerns are outside the scope.
- Concurrency control on API level is not required. 
  When updating device information, a client may rely on previously requested data 
  that may have become stale by the time it sends an update.

### Design Decisions
The solution follows the hexagonal architecture concepts.
That is, the periphery components (persistence and API) reference the application logic,
while the logic is self-contained.
Wherever possible, objects are kept immutable.

The logic in this CRU(D) application is trivial.
Nevertheless, this approach was chosen in order to present the general development style.

### Data model
Every device type, such as `Computer` is represented by its own class, extending the abstract `Device` class.

### Persistence
For the data store, two types of databases would have been suitable:
- an relational database like PostgreSQL
- a document store like MongoDB

Both would allow all four required operations to be performant at scale.
As for ACID guarantees, they are offered by both, traditional SQL databases 
and latest versions of modern document stores.

The device configurations do not share any relationship with each other, as of the current requirements,
hence a document store would serve well.

However, it might be a safer choice to remain flexible for future requirements. 
An example could be the ability to select those devices that have a certain type or belong to a certain set of coworking spaces,
like _all computers in German offices_. 
Such relationships are more easily represented in a relational database.
Therefore, for this application, PostgreSQL has been chosen as the persistence solution

### Data model and entity mapping
The application's persistence layer leverages JPA/Hibernate as the ORM, together with Spring Data.

To represent the data model in the relational database,
out of JPA's four common inheritance mapping strategies, _table per class_ has been chosen.
Each concrete device type, such as _computer_, has its own database table,
avoiding nullable columns for values only available for that device type
and also name clashes for semantically different values.

No _join_ will be required for the queries, 
while the polymorphic retrieval of all devices is supported through a _union_ query.
The inheritance hierarchy of the entities at the persistence layer mirrors the data model.
The device id is used as the primary key.

### API layer
The application provides a REST API to its clients with the following endpoints:
- `POST /devices` creates a new configuration for a device
- `PUT /devices/<device id>` replaces a device configuration
- `PATCH /devices/<device id>` updates values in a device configuration
- `GET /devices/<device id>` retrieves a single device configuration
- `GET /devices` lists the configurations of all devices

Hypermedia (HATEOAS) is not supported.

## Challenges and proposed solutions
### Hexagonal Architecture
Should Spring Boot annotations be allowed in core application package?

Current solution: 
The application package is fully framework-agnostic.
Instead of having the `@Service` annotation on the service classes,
the service beans are created through a `@Configuration` in the boot package.

The annotation `@Transaction` would make sense on the service classes as well.
However, it is put on the method ´transactional` in the JPA implementation
of the `DeviceRepository` interface.
### JPA mapping strategy for polymorphic types
### REST PATCH: polymorphic types
Goal: Allowing to update devices through a REST PATCH query, such as:
`PATCH /devices/lenovo-XR1823`
with a body as follows:
```json 
{
    "name": "pc-123",
    "ipAddress": "1.1.1.1",
}
```
ideas:
- required `type` argument, either in payload or in URL
- working with key/value maps
questions:
- who's responsibility is it to know how to update?
  - should the REST controller request the original data for the item
    and replace the specified items?
  - should the application logic be responsible for doing this?
  - should this be left to the persistence layer that might perform an optimized database update?
  The decision went for the latter option, so depending on the underlying 
### REST PATCH: nullable fields 
### Creating and updating device resources
#### _POST_ vs. _PUT_
Creating new devices and updating exiting ones could have been designed in two different ways:

1. A device resource is both created and updated using a _PUT_ request.
2. A _POST_ request is used for creating a device resource, a _PUT_ request for updating it.

Since the ID is specified by the API client instead of being generated by the service, 
a _PUT_ request would have been well possible to use for both operations, 
as idempotency would be preserved.

However, in order to provide the ability to the consumer of the API differentiate between both operations 
and to avoid data being overridden accidentally, the decision was taken in favor of solution 2. 
The client should be aware of whether a device should be created or overridden upfront 
and applying the wrong operation should result in an error.

#### _PUT_ vs. _PATCH_
Another question deals with updating a resource.
Should the full resource be sent at all times in order to be updated
or should the client send only the values to be updated?

In order to allow single values to be updated without the need to send the full resource data,
an incremental update has been allowed through the _PATCH_ method.

#### _PATCH_ and _PUT_
A full update to a device using the _PUT_ method is also possible.
Having the _PUT_ endpoint alongside _PATCH_
allows a client to send equal structured device representations for both creation (_POST_) and modification (_PUT_),
whereas a document update sent as _PATCH_ cannot include non-modifiable fields, such as the ID.
